# CharTest
Load a custom character set in the Commodore 64

This is a utility program for the Commodore 64.
It will load a binary file (character set) from disk into memory and set it as the character set to use.

I developed this as a tool to test character sets that I create with a character editing program.
The program is not optimized, just very plain to be most transparent what is happening.

Use cc65 to compile.
